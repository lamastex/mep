# databricks notebooks since 2016

Here is a set of databricks notebooks developed under Project MEP since 2016.

These notebooks were developed by various collaborators and they are committed here for Spark 3.x and Scala 2.12.

The objective is to refactor reusable parts of these notebook codes into a library for twitter research in Scala/Spark.
